# Birthday-Gift-Advisor

## Inspiration
The idea for the Birthday Gift Advisor came from the common challenge of choosing the perfect gift for friends and family. By using AI and common sense reasoning, I aimed to create a tool that could provide personalized gift recommendations based on a variety of factors.

## What it does
It takes into account the recipient's industry, the closeness of the relationship, the user's budget, income, and willingness to spend. The system also considers mother's recommendations as a constant factor. Using s(CASP) for common sense reasoning and simulated deep learning techniques, the app provides tailored gift suggestions.

## How we built it
I defined a comprehensive set of rules and facts in Prolog to determine gift categories and prices. I used s(CASP) for common sense reasoning to simulate human-like decision-making. When I created a simple and intuitive web interface using HTML and JavaScript to interact with the Prolog system, it simply collected user input and displayed gift recommendations.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating s(CASP) for common sense reasoning was challenging as it was my first time. Designing a flexible and comprehensive knowledge base that could handle various scenarios was complex but essential for the app's success.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Developed a simple and intuitive web interface that allows users to easily input data and receive recommendations. Plus I had fun.

## What we learned
Learned how to simulate deep learning techniques in constrained environments. Gained a deeper understanding of Prolog and s(CASP) for common sense reasoning.

## What's next for Birthday Gift Advisor
Incorporate user feedback to improve the app's accuracy and usability, expand the knowledge base to include more industries, relationships, and gift categories, and integrate actual deep learning models when it felt like it wasn't going to work if I did now.
